# CriblVision

CriblVision is a troubleshooting tool and monitoring aid for Cribl administrators. It was created by Cribl Support Engineers to help customers troubleshoot their own Cribl deployments. There are several troubleshooting dashboards tailored to certain product areas in which support has seen the highest number of recurring issues. And while our intent is to help you troubleshoot your own Cribl deployment, this app will always be a continual "work in progress" and should always be used in conjunction with the Cribl Monitoring Console and associated views.

Currently, there are three instances of CriblVision:
* [https://github.com/criblio/criblvision/tree/main/criblvision-for-criblsearch](CriblVision for CriblSearch)
* [https://github.com/criblio/criblvision/tree/main/criblvision-for-grafana](CriblVision for Grafana)
* [https://github.com/criblio/criblvision/tree/main/criblvision-for-splunk](CriblVision for Splunk)

For more information on each, please see the README in their respective directories.
