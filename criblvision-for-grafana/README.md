# CriblVision for Grafana

## Getting Started

This Grafana dashboard was created by Cribl Support Engineers to help customers troubleshoot their own Cribl deployments. It is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of the health and performance of a Cribl deployment.  This was designed to be used in conjunction with the Cribl Monitoring Console.

#### Logs and Metrics <!-- markdownlint-disable -->

Cribl internal logs and metrics must be enabled and forwarded to Prometheus(metrics) and Loki(logs) destinations in order for all of the panels to populate with events. Refer to the documentation [here](https://docs.cribl.io/stream/sources-cribl-internal/#configuring-cribl-internal-logsmetrics-as-a-datasource) for instructions on configuring this Source.

For this dashboard, you will need a Loki instance as well as a Prometheus instance with Remote Write enabled with the following flag: `--enable-feature=remote-write-receiver`

#### Leader Logs

Some of the view in this app will require Leader logs to be forwarded to Grafana. In distributed Cribl Stream environments, Leader logs are currently *NOT* sent via our internal Source. You will have to install a Cribl Edge Node on your Leader Node and configure local log collection via a file monitor input. Configure the file monitor input to collect logs by configuring the filename modal to `/opt/cribl/log/*`. For more information on how to deploy a Cribl Edge Node, please refer to our documentation [here](https://docs.cribl.io/edge/deploy-planning).

#### Source and Destination configuration in Cribl

For your internal logs source, you will need to configure the following:

* Source
  * `group` field should be set to the name of the Worker Group
* Destination
  * `prometheus_metrics` pipeline should be enabled for the `Prometheus` destination
  * `service` set to `Cribl` for Loki destination under `Advanced Settings`

### Using This Dashboard

In addition to this overview page, this app provides several views intended to aid a Cribl admin in troubleshooting and assessing the health of a Cribl deployment. We recommend starting with the Health Check view and selecting a single Worker Group or Worker Node from the provided filters.
